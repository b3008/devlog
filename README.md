### A development blog that writes itself — through the AI agent you already use.

Most developers don't keep a dev log — or they abandon one within a week. But
AI coding agents already sit in the loop where the work happens. `devlog`
teaches them, once per project, to narrate that work as they go.

The result: a time-ordered, portfolio-ready record of your project that
grows automatically, in the agent's own voice.

<br>

## Quickstart

Two commands. No install.

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/b3008/devlog.git devlog init
uvx --from git+https://github.com/b3008/devlog.git devlog install --ai claude
```

Or install it as a `uv` tool for repeated use:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/b3008/devlog.git
devlog init && devlog install --ai claude
```

<br>

## What actually happens

`devlog install` drops a single, bracketed block into your agent's context
file — leaving whatever you already had intact:

```diff
  # My Project
  <existing CLAUDE.md content stays untouched>
+
+ <!-- DEVLOG:START - Do not edit this section manually -->
+ ## Development Blog (Automatic)
+ After every session where meaningful progress is made, create or
+ update a blog entry in `blog/`.
+ ...triggers, structure, voice, tags, media instructions...
+ <!-- DEVLOG:END -->
```

From then on, the agent writes entries like this without being asked:

```markdown
---
title: "Tag vocabulary now self-updates"
date: 2026-04-16
tags: [feature, cli, ux]
summary: "devlog install now folds tags from existing entries into the rendered vocabulary."
---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `devlog init [--name NAME]` | Scaffold `.devlog/`, `blog/`, `blog/media/`, `blog/_index.md`, and `.devlog/learned.md`. |
| `devlog install --ai <key>` | Inject the convention into the agent's context file. Auto-runs `init` if needed. |
| `devlog uninstall --ai <key>` | Remove the convention section and manifest. |
| `devlog list` | List all supported agents. |
| `devlog status` | Show which agents currently have the convention active. |
| `devlog version` | Print version. |

<br>

## Adaptive convention

The convention isn't a frozen snapshot. Three lightweight mechanisms let it
grow with the project:

> **`.devlog/learned.md`** — a shared notebook the agent reads before writing
> and appends to when durable project knowledge surfaces (domain vocabulary,
> recurring themes, open threads). It lives outside the injected sentinel
> block, so accumulation is free and diffable. Humans can edit it too.

> **Self-updating tag vocabulary** — on each `devlog install`, entries in
> `blog/` are scanned and any tags found in their frontmatter are unioned
> into the rendered tag list. The agent is told it may introduce new tags
> when they genuinely fit; the next install folds them into the canonical
> vocabulary.

> **Self-tailoring config** — if the default triggers or voice don't match
> the project's domain (say, creative writing rather than a code project),
> the injected convention instructs the agent to propose edits to
> `config.yaml` and prompt the user to re-run install. The tool adapts to
> the project rather than the other way around.

Together these let the convention absorb what the project has actually been
doing — without anyone curating `config.yaml` by hand.

### Is it working?

`devlog status` reports whether entries are actually being produced — not
just whether the sentinel block is present. If the install is more than a
day old and no entries have been written, it prints a warning with
remediation hints.

## Supported agents

Three agents have dedicated context files:

| Key | Agent | Context file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| `gemini` | Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |

Run `devlog list` for the live registry.

## How it works

1. **`init`** drops a default `.devlog/config.yaml`, creates the blog
   skeleton, and scaffolds `.devlog/learned.md`.
2. **`install`** renders the config into a markdown block and writes it to
   the agent's context file between sentinel markers. Existing content is
   preserved; re-installing replaces only the section between the sentinels.
   A SHA-256 of the resulting file is saved to
   `.devlog/manifests/<agent>.manifest.json`.
3. **`uninstall`** strips the sentinel block and removes the manifest.

### Layout after install

```
your-project/
├── .devlog/

│   ├── learned.md               # agent-maintained project notebook
│   └── manifests/

└── CLAUDE.md                    # convention injected between sentinels
```

<br>

## Configuration

Edit `.devlog/config.yaml` to customize:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `blog_dir` / `media_dir` / `index_file` | Where entries and media live. |
| `sections` | Headings each entry should have. |
| `voice` | Tone and audience guidelines baked into the convention. |
| `triggers` | When the agent should write an entry. |
| `tags` | Base tag vocabulary (auto-extended by discovery). |
| `frontmatter` | YAML frontmatter fields for each entry. |
| `media` | Screenshot/capture instructions. Set `enabled: false` to skip. |

Re-run `devlog install --ai <key>` after editing to regenerate the injected
section.
